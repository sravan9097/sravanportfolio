## Project Overview

Sharechat Ads platform aims to revolutionise the lead generation campaign process for high-paying clients by introducing a self-service feature that allows advertisers to create and customise forms independently. This project addresses the current challenges faced by the marketing team, designers, and developers in launching campaigns, by reducing the time required to launch a campaign from one to three weeks to a matter of days. By enabling advertisers to have more control over their campaigns, Sharechat Ads platform expects to increase the number of advertisers and revenue significantly.

## The Challenge

As ShareChat's ad platform matured, we identified a recurring blocker: advertisers were unable to create or manage lead generation forms without internal support. This created bottlenecks, slowed down campaign launches, and introduced quality issues due to manual handovers.

> The goal was clear: Design a feature that enables advertisers to create and customize lead generation forms independently — streamlining the process and reducing dependencies.

## Discovery & Research

To kick things off, I collaborated closely with product, ads ops, and engineering teams to identify pain points and map out the ideal workflow. I also conducted platform benchmarking to analyze how similar solutions were built by Meta, Google, and InMobi.

### Key Insights:

- Advertisers needed speed and flexibility.
- Internal teams spent hours handling requests that could be automated.
- There was no visibility into the actual lead data structure during campaign setup.

## Process Overview

We followed a Double Diamond approach, moving from research to definition, then exploring solutions before refining the best one.

### 1. Understanding the User & Goals

Created user personas for campaign managers, media buyers, and ops stakeholders. This helped prioritize use cases like quick form deployment, previewing designs, and lead analytics compatibility.

### 2. Ideation & Mapping

- Conducted mind mapping and user flow design.
- Created form state logic: default templates, validation, data syncing.
- Mapped user journeys from campaign creation to form submission and backend sync.

## Wireframes & Exploration

Designed multiple versions of form templates — exploring layouts, card styles, and field logic. Early concepts tested:

- Single-column vs. dual-view layouts
- Static templates vs. dynamic drag-and-drop fields
- Preview interactions before publishing

We iterated quickly based on internal feedback and usability reviews, narrowing down to two clear card formats:

  <img src="/sharechat/layout.png" alt="Layout Concepts" />
</div>

## Final Designs & Prototyping

The final design included:

- Form Builder UI with field customization, previews, and styling tools
- Clean, responsive UI optimized for mobile creation
- Templates that adapt to campaign type

I created a high-fidelity prototype with real interactions to simulate the creation experience and demo it to stakeholders.

### Key Features:

- Template selection with instant preview
- Field control: title, placeholder, type (dropdown, number, etc.)
- Visual customization for brand consistency
- Integration-ready lead output format

## The Challenge

BeautifulCode wanted a website that felt **geeky yet calm**, designed _by engineers, for engineers_.  
The goal: a site that spoke to CTOs and senior devs without the fluff of corporate marketing.

> “We are engineers who care deeply about our craft.”

The challenge: capture that authenticity, a **developer-first aesthetic** that's professional, simple, and real.

## The Approach

### Understanding the Core Vision

BeautifulCode’s team shared an initial wireframe that shaped the foundation.

Core system elements:

- **Font:** IBM Flex Mono: technical and grounded
- **Palette:** Low-contrast backgrounds, strong text focus
- **Sections:** “What We’re Wired For” (key capabilities) and “Foundation Principles” (engineering beliefs)

The homepage acted as a **calm, navigational hub**, guiding users through articles and case studies.

## Wireframing & Early Concepts

### Wireframing

Low-fidelity wireframes explored homepage and category layouts.  
Focus on: smiple, minimal.

<div class="wireframeGrid">
  <img src="/beautifulcode-revamp/wireframe1.png" alt="Wireframe Iteration 1" />
  <img src="/beautifulcode-revamp/wireframe3.png" alt="Wireframe Iteration 2" />
</div>

### Concept Exploration

I explored **two directions**:

- _Retro Windows 92 UI_: nostalgic, hacker vibe, pixel grid, monospaced.
- _Modern Bento layout_: structured, airy, clear hierarchy.
<div class="wireframeGrid">
  <img src="/beautifulcode-revamp/theme1screen1.png" alt="Retro Windows 92 UI" />
  <img src="/beautifulcode-revamp/theme2screen1.png" alt="Modern Bento layout" />
</div>

> Feedback: "Feels too boxed in, more like a dashboard than a workspace."

So I stripped away containers, leaned on **white space, typography, and rhythm**, letting simplicity lead.

## Final Layout & High-Fidelity Prototype

After multiple iterations, the final design captured BeautifulCode's **developer-first personality**: minimal, structured, and authentic.

### Design Direction

Stripped of clutter, the design emphasized:

- **Vertical rhythm** and generous spacing
- **Monospaced hierarchy** with IBM Flex Mono
- **Whitespace over containers**
- **Quiet micro-interactions**: smooth, functional, thoughtful

The homepage became a **content hub**, guiding users seamlessly across sections.

### Interactivity

The clickable prototype validated structure and flow:

- Interactive navigation
- Expandable article lists
- Responsive layouts for real-world use

> "It feels more like a curated dev wiki: structured, clean, authentic."

## Building the Design System with Atomic Design

To keep the site scalable and consistent, I built the UI using **Atomic Design**, turning components into reusable parts.

### Why Atomic Design?

Shared structures across pages made this system ideal.  
It provided **clarity, consistency, and easy iteration** as the site evolved.

### The Breakdown

<div data-carousel="design-system-slides"></div>

## Final UI – Desktop & Mobile

High-fidelity designs applied the system across breakpoints: clean, consistent, and responsive.  
Many leadership visitors land on mobile first, so I prioritized **mobile clarity** from the start.

### Desktop Screens

<div data-carousel="desktop-screens"></div>

### Mobile Screens

<div data-carousel="mobile-screens"></div>

### Outcome

> A calm, developer-first site, built by engineers, for engineers.

- Minimal, content-driven experience
- Nostalgic yet modern visual language
- Scalable design system
- Fully responsive across devices

### Reflections

This project reinforced a simple truth: **clarity beats flash**.  
Through iteration and restraint, I learned how **typography and rhythm** can define brand personality.

It pushed both my **system thinking** and **interaction design** skills, and reminded me that great UX often comes from doing less, thoughtfully.

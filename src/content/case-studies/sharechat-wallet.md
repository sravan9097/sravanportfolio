## The Challenge

ShareChat Business allows advertisers to run ad campaigns by first adding money to a prepaid wallet. This wallet recharge flow is a critical conversion point, especially for first-time and small-budget advertisers.

However, existing data and user feedback indicated hesitation, confusion, and drop-offs at this step — directly impacting advertiser activation and revenue.

**Key Pain Points:**

- Lack of trust: Users questioned whether ads would work and if money was refundable
- No visibility into value: Users wanted clarity similar to Facebook or Instagram ads
- High entry barrier: ₹10,000 felt too high for first-time advertisers
- Confusing minimum amount rules: Unclear about recharge constraints
- Overloaded credit messaging: Terms like free credits were misunderstood

> "How do I know I'll get value for my money? There are no reviews or proofs that this works."

## User Research & Key Insights

We conducted qualitative research focused on advertiser behavior during wallet recharge to understand their pain points and decision-making process.

### Key Findings

**Lack of Trust**  
Users questioned whether ads would work and if money was refundable.

**No Visibility Into Value**  
Users wanted clarity similar to Facebook or Instagram ads: "What reach will I get if I add this amount?"

**High Entry Barrier**  
₹10,000 felt too high for many first-time advertisers. Even ₹5,000 felt risky.

**Confusing Minimum Amount Rules**  
Users were unclear about minimum recharge constraints and why certain amounts were invalid.

**Overloaded Credit Messaging**  
Terms like free credits, promotional credits, and ad credits were misunderstood and assumed as guaranteed outcomes.

## Design Principles

Based on research and competitive learnings from platforms like Paytm, PhonePe, Amazon Pay, and Zerodha, the solution followed these principles:

- **Clarity before persuasion** — Users need to understand the value before being convinced to pay
- **Lower the entry barrier** — Make the first step less intimidating for new advertisers
- **Make value tangible** — Show what users get at every step of the process
- **Reduce cognitive load** — Minimize mental effort during financial decisions
- **Build trust organically** — Establish credibility without marketing noise

## Key UX Decisions

### 1. Clear Minimum & Recommended Amounts
Instead of letting users guess, we clearly highlighted the minimum recharge amount and used 'Popular choice' as a soft nudge to guide decision-making without being pushy.

**Impact:** Eliminates confusion about recharge constraints and reduces failed attempts

### 2. Structured Amount Comparison
Each amount card shows exactly what users get, eliminating mental math and making value transparent at a glance.

**Impact:** Users can quickly compare options and make informed decisions

### 3. Simplified Credit Messaging
We created a clear distinction between wallet balance and promotional credits, reducing misleading assumptions about guaranteed outcomes.

**Impact:** Reduced confusion and support queries about credit types

### 4. Transparent Pricing
GST is clearly shown near the CTA, and total payable amount is visible at the decision moment, not after clicking.

**Impact:** Builds trust by showing all costs upfront, no surprises

### 5. Subtle Trust Signals
Platform credibility is surfaced through subtle cues without overwhelming users with marketing messages.

**Impact:** Increases confidence without creating noise or distraction

## Outcomes & Impact

**Improved Clarity**  
Reduced confusion during recharge decision-making through transparent pricing and clear value communication.

**Stronger Confidence**  
First-time advertisers felt more confident about adding money through subtle trust signals.

**Better Alignment**  
Aligned marketing promises with product experience, reducing confusion around credits and offers.

## What I Learned

**Early exploration of multiple directions pays off**  
Testing various wireframe layouts helped identify the optimal structure before investing in high-fidelity design.

**Ground design decisions in user trust, not just conversion**  
When users feel safe and informed, they're more likely to complete the action willingly.

**Use competitive analysis as behavioral guidance**  
Understanding patterns from high-trust platforms helped establish familiar, reliable patterns.

**Transparency builds confidence in financial decisions**  
Showing all costs upfront and making value tangible reduces hesitation and support queries.

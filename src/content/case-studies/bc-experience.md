## The Challenge

The BC Experience platform was facing significant usability challenges that were impacting team productivity and member engagement. The existing interface was cluttered, difficult to navigate, and lacked the intuitive flow needed for effective team collaboration and member management.

The key challenges identified were:

- **Complex Navigation**: Users struggled to find key features and information
- **Poor Member Management**: Difficult to track and manage team members effectively
- **Inefficient Check-in Process**: The check-in workflow was cumbersome and time-consuming
- **Lack of Visual Hierarchy**: Important information was buried in dense layouts
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Poor experience on mobile devices

## Understanding the Problem

### User Research & Analysis

I conducted extensive user research to understand the pain points and user needs:

- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Spoke with team leads, managers, and regular users
- **User Journey Mapping**: Analyzed current workflows and identified friction points
- **Usability Testing**: Observed users interacting with the existing platform
- **Competitive Analysis**: Studied similar platforms to understand best practices

### Key Insights

The research revealed several critical insights:

- **Users spent 40% more time** on tasks than necessary due to poor navigation
- **Team leads struggled** to get visibility into member activities and progress
- **Check-in process** was the most frustrating part of the user experience
- **Mobile usage** was increasing but the platform wasn't optimized for it

> "We need a platform that feels intuitive and helps us focus on what matters most - our team and their progress."

## The Approach

### Design Strategy

I adopted a user-centered design approach with the following principles:

1. **Simplify Navigation**: Create clear, logical information architecture
2. **Enhance Visibility**: Provide better insights into team and member activities
3. **Streamline Workflows**: Reduce steps and cognitive load for common tasks
4. **Mobile-First**: Ensure excellent experience across all devices
5. **Consistent Design Language**: Establish cohesive visual patterns

### Information Architecture

I restructured the platform's information architecture to improve discoverability and usability:

#### Primary Navigation

- **Dashboard**: Overview of team activities and key metrics
- **Members**: Comprehensive member management and profiles
- **Check-ins**: Streamlined check-in process and history
- **Settings**: Team configuration and preferences

#### Secondary Features

- **Reports**: Analytics and insights
- **Notifications**: Activity updates and alerts
- **Help**: Support and documentation

## Design Process & Iterations

### Wireframing & Early Concepts

I started with low-fidelity wireframes to explore different layout approaches and user flows:

  <img src="/bc-experience/wireframe2.png" alt="Navigation Structure" />
</div>

### Member Management Redesign

The member management section was completely redesigned to provide better visibility and control:

#### Single Member View

- **Comprehensive Profile**: All member information in one place
- **Activity Timeline**: Visual representation of member progress
- **Quick Actions**: Easy access to common tasks
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual cues for member status

#### Team Overview

- **Member Grid**: Visual representation of all team members
- **Status Overview**: Quick glance at team health and progress
- **Bulk Actions**: Efficient management of multiple members
- **Filtering & Search**: Easy member discovery and organization

### Check-in Process Optimization

The check-in process was the most critical area for improvement. I redesigned it to be more intuitive and efficient:

#### Check-in Creation

- **Step-by-Step Flow**: Clear progression through the check-in process
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-filled information based on context
- **Guidelines Integration**: Built-in guidance and best practices
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback on completion status

#### Guidelines & CTA Integration

- **Contextual Help**: Guidelines appear when needed
- **Clear Call-to-Actions**: Obvious next steps and actions
- **Validation Feedback**: Immediate feedback on form completion
- **Save Progress**: Ability to save and continue later

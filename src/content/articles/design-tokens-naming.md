> Good names reduce cognitive load and make systems predictable.

Design tokens are the shared language between design and engineering. Clear names help AI, designers, and developers reason about intent.

1. Prefer purpose over appearance.
2. Encode semantics, not values.
3. Keep names predictable and composable.

```
color.background.surface.default
color.text.muted
space.inline.lg
```

This is a website i am building for myself. I am a UX designer and I am building a portfolio for myself to showcase the projects i worked on till now and ongoing. 

Your job is help me build it and make it look good and user friendly. Also help with the content when needed. 

Please use tailwindcss for styling and react for the framework. 

In backend i have added supabase for database and for contact form i have added supabase functions. When user fills the contact form it should be stored in the database and i should get an email notification. 

Please make the website responsive and user friendly. 

Below is the new case study i am working on. Please help me with the design. I will add image and content when needed. Your job is create a new project page and add it to the portfolio. Use the existing template and structure with the same colro and text styles. If needed to create any new component or style, please create it and use it in the project page.

Please use the below case study 

🧠 BeautifulCode Website Redesign
Engineers Who Care About Engineering
✨ Project Summary
Client: BeautifulCode
Role: UX & UI Designer
Duration: ~8 weeks
Deliverables: Responsive website design, interactive prototype, icon system, style guide
Tools: Figma, Slack, Google Fonts, Pen & Paper
Goal: Create a calm, minimal, geek-friendly website that reflects BeautifulCode’s engineering culture and showcases thought leadership.

🎯 The Challenge
BeautifulCode is a collective of senior engineers and technical leaders. Their goal was to create a website that would:

Reflect their deep engineering expertise

Convey a calm, geeky developer vibe

Appeal to CTOs, tech leads, and C-suite executives

🗣️ “We want the site to feel like it's made by people who love writing code. No fluff. Just thoughtful simplicity.”

They provided an early wireframe and the core idea:
“What We’re Wired For” — a section that shows their strongest engineering domains.

🔍 Discovery & Research
I kicked off the project by studying:

Their engineering values and internal culture

The audience: experienced technical professionals

Design references: minimal, developer-focused websites

Interaction models that emphasize clarity and control

The goal was to design with respect for cognitive focus — like clean, readable code.

✏️ Wireframing & Navigation Concepts
🔹 First Iteration
3×2 Bento-style grid for categories

2×2 grid for Foundation Principles

Icons + cards layout

🟥 Feedback:

“Too structured… too boxed in. It feels like a dashboard.”

🔹 Second Iteration
I stripped the chrome, removed containers, and relied on:

White space

Careful alignment

Hierarchy in typography

This helped communicate a sense of engineering calm and shifted the homepage into a navigational hub.

✅ Approved by the team as the new direction

📸 [Insert screenshots of Wireframe V1 vs V2]

💡 High-Fidelity Prototype & Shared Transitions
To bring the navigation to life, I created an interactive prototype with shared element transitions:

The homepage category tiles smoothly transform into the left sidebar on the category page

Articles and Case Studies slide in from the right in two columns

Load More interaction reveals additional content seamlessly

📸 [Showcase this with GIFs or Figma prototype preview]

✅ This flow was finalized and praised for its clarity

📄 Article & Case Study Listing Design
Each category page required:

Clean layout for articles & case studies

Display: Title, Date, and Technology Tags

I explored 2–3 iterations for listing styles, balancing:

Typography readability

Tag visibility

Density of information without clutter

📸 [Show the evolution of list views — use before/after or side-by-side]

✅ Final version emphasized scanability and minimized scroll.

🎨 Visual Language & Style Guide
A big part of the project was creating a distinct visual identity that speaks to engineers.

Fonts:
Chosen: IBM Flex Mono

Reason: Feels like a terminal or system font — conveys a “developer” tone

Colors:
Muted background color

Minimal contrast for elegance, strong contrast where needed for content

📐 Style Guide Includes:

Typography

Colors

Spacing System

Icon Grid (512×512px with 24px padding)

Button & Interaction States

📸 [Include typography spec, color swatches, button states]

🧩 Icon System & Technology Tags
To reinforce identity, I created a custom tech icon system:

All icons follow a 512×512 grid with 24px padding

Icons are centered, square, and visually balanced

Categories are grouped in Figma’s “Tech Icons” page for easy updates

Workflow:
Team members submit new tech requests via Slack with a logo reference

I design, polish, and add it to the system

📸 [Include icon grid samples, icon anatomy, tech tag layout]

📱 Mobile-First Thinking
Recognizing that many first-time visitors may arrive via mobile, I started designing for mobile in parallel:

Categories turn into vertical nav

Article cards stack vertically

Load More adapted for scroll

📸 [Show mobile vs desktop view comparison]

📚 Final Pages
Home Page

Category Page (e.g., Frontend Craft)

Article / Case Study Detail Page

Foundation Principles List Page

Principle Detail Page

Each page was validated through:

Daily Slack feedback loops

Internal reviews with engineering leads

Iteration based on clarity, calm, and technical professionalism

📸 [Add clean screens for each final page, mocked in device frames if possible]

💡 Highlight: Article Visual Consistency
One insight I raised during the project:

“We need a visual language for the artifacts inside articles — tables, flow charts, architecture diagrams.”

These elements often vary in style and tone. I suggested:

Establishing a standard illustration style

Creating reusable blocks for charts, diagrams, and visuals

📌 This is now being scoped as a separate design initiative.

🔁 Process Snapshots
📸 Include these visuals if available:

Whiteboard photos or sticky notes

Figma in-progress views

Slack feedback exchanges (blurred usernames if needed)

Mobile vs desktop iteration breakdown

✅ Outcome
The final design was:

✅ Aligned with the engineering culture

✅ Clean, minimal, and reader-focused

✅ Fully responsive

✅ Scalable with a growing icon system and design system

💬 Final Thoughts
Designing for engineers taught me to design like one — with precision, minimalism, and logic.

The BeautifulCode site reflects more than just skills — it reflects craft, restraint, and clarity.
This case reminded me that great design is often invisible, letting the content (and code) speak for itself.

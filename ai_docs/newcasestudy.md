📍 Background & Context

ShareChat Business allows advertisers to run ad campaigns by first adding money to a prepaid wallet. This wallet recharge flow is a critical conversion point, especially for first-time and small-budget advertisers.

However, existing data and user feedback indicated hesitation, confusion, and drop-offs at this step — directly impacting advertiser activation and revenue.

🚨 Problem Statement

Advertisers lacked trust, clarity, and confidence while adding money to the wallet due to unclear value communication, high perceived financial risk, and confusing credit-related messaging — resulting in hesitation and drop-offs at a critical conversion step.

🎯 Business & User Goals
Business Goals

Increase successful wallet recharges

Improve first-time advertiser activation

Reduce friction and support queries related to recharge

User Goals

Understand how much to add

Know what value they get in return

Feel safe and confident before making a payment

🔍 User Research & Insights

We conducted qualitative research focused on advertiser behavior during wallet recharge.

Key Insights
1. Lack of Trust

Users questioned whether ads would work and if money was refundable.

“How do I know I’ll get value for my money?”
“There are no reviews or proofs that this works.”

2. No Visibility Into Value

Users wanted clarity similar to Facebook or Instagram ads.

“What reach will I get if I add this amount?”

3. High Entry Barrier

₹10,000 felt too high for many first-time advertisers. Even ₹5,000 felt risky.

4. Confusing Minimum Amount Rules

Users were unclear about minimum recharge constraints and why certain amounts were invalid.

5. Overloaded Credit Messaging

Terms like free credits, promotional credits, and ad credits were misunderstood and assumed as guaranteed outcomes.
